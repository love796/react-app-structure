# React App structure

Basic folder structure and configs files that I use for my react projects. All of this are as per my personal preferences.

### Various parts of this repo contains:

-   VSCode recommended settings and extensions.
-   Source folder structure.
-   Various configs for eslint, typescript, prettier and styler.

Please note: currently package.json contains additional packages and script that I use.
